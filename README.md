# Cat-Name-Generator_backEnd
This app can help you find the purrfect name for your new cat friend. Using Java, SpringBoot and a custom-made API, this application combines with a front-end app (link here) to generate names specifically created to fit fur balls fantastically.

Select the button with the characteristic which most closely resembles your cat from the provided options on each of the four quesion pages. Then click the generate name button on the last page to find a new option for your fuzzy, feline friend.
